Taken from the interview with a Chinese girl, who lived in Russia for about half of year:

1. Russians are more lazy, Chinese are more hard-woking <b>&#42;</b>
2. Russians are more civilized, than Chinese (meaning Russians have more artists, musicians people of art)
3. Drivers give way to pedestrians, as well as to other drivers, while in China, even if you're on a pedestrian crossing - you have no rights at all.
4. Russian drivers don't honk as often and as much, as Chinese drivers do.
5. Russians barely talk to each other, in contrast to Chinese, who are friendly and often help each other <b>&#42;&#42;</b>
6. Russians read more, than Chinese do (especially you can see it in the transport)
7. Russians are <b>very contradictive</b> - double, or nothing. Either happiness, either the end of the world. The same thing about emotions.
8. Russians don't jump the queue (those who've been in China will smile a big competent smile :D )
9. Russians love their country (in a different way, not like Chinese do.) <b>&#42;&#42;&#42;</b>
10. Russians are heroes. Chinese are way too cautious. 

With which feature of Russians you'd like to endow Chinese people ?
- diligence (again, it's the main problem of Russians, as many Chinese say)

With which feature of Chinese you'd like to endow Russians ?
- heroism, bravery

We've got an interesting portrait of Russian person: lazy and brave, not controlling emotions, unsociable hero, who likes to read and doesn't jump the queue.

<b>&#42;</b> Actually, Chinese are very good at working for the show, or working without thinking (埋头傻干). They like to sleep and hate to go to work as well. Yet they are more disciplined, than Russians, which makes the whole difference.
<b>&#42;&#42;</b> It's true that Chinese are much more friendly to foreigners, than Russians are. Yet the concept of "friendship" differ a lot in these two countries. Chinese meaning of "friend" (朋友) is fellow, pal. So it's very easy to become their "best friends" overnight. In Russia word "friend" actually means "intimate, close friend". That's why Russians feel awkward when Chinese person after knowing them for only a couple of minutes, is very possible to call them their best friend.
<b>&#42;&#42;&#42;</b> Lots of Russians have the concept of scolding their motherland only between themselves. They won't show it to foreigners (Chinese). That's why Chinese sometimes get wrong understanding of real situation. Chinese, in some ways, have common behavior, yet Chinese in general are a bit more pround of China, than Russians of Russia.
