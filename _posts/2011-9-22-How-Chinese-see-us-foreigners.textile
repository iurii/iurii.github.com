Every day I have a couple of interviews with people who are totally mistaken.
They hate Japanese, yet study the language of nacist country, where they get beaten and get killed (welcome to Russia).

I discovered a lot:

1. People of Kiev and Kharkov treat Chinese much more coldly, than Crimean people (South of Ukraine)
2. Chinese believe, that education in Russia is better. Say, in China teachers don't care what they teach, the salaries are low. Lots of hometasks and rote-learning.
3. Having had dozens of interviews, I haven't heard even one Chinese who's accent would be at least in some way similar to no-accent standard Russian language.
4. They live in their weird naive world. Sometimes you talk to a man and think to yourself "GODS! What the hell ?".
For example, I've had several people questioned the same question "Which country would you like to visit, except Russia ?". The answer was "Russia". Then I ask the same question and they repeat the same answer.
Then you start helping, pointing out that there might be(by some occasion and coinsidence) other countries.
- If you had a huge lot of money, would you go to, say, USA ?
- No
- Why ?
- I don't like USA
- Well, have you been there (trying to point out their narrow-mindness)
- No
- So why don't you like it? (I don't give up)
- They are always at war (yeah, hell of an argument)

I might as well not even try to ask the question about going to Japan. The same thing is about European countries. People don't want to know anything except of Russia or maybe Ukraine.
When I was asking people about their aims and goals of life, there was only one guy, who wanted to be rich.
The majority just wants to become interpreter. Some of these people weren't even good enough in wrighting in Chinese(taking into consideration that it's their local language!)
Sometimes there were people who were saying that all Russians are kind and beautiful.
At the same time I often ask a person about his hobbies. In general it's not possible to hear something except "I play basketball".
They live in the world where there exists study of Russian language and basketball only.

A whole bunch of LULZ. Crowds of mistaken people. What if I'm an idiot too ? What if I should have chosen Canada ?
Maybe, but, as I'm here, I should at least improve my Chinese to the level where I would be not ashamed of it.
