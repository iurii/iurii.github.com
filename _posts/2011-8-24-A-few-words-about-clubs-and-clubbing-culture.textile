So, clubs, right? The most popular way for young people to hang out, rest and spend time.

So, you voluntarily:

1) put yourself in a very limited space with lots of people
-1 feeling of safety
-1 hygiene

2) in the same space you give your ears and nerve system huge overloads
-1 health

3) at the same place your eyes get millions of flares and color distraction
-1 health

4) at the same place you usually go for a round of drinks
at the same time playing drink games
-1 health

5) And what was all that "going to the club" thing? About communication and meeting people! - Let me expalain it to you - it's when you use all your power to shout out the words to someone who stands
very close to you and still can not hear a thing.
-1 communication

6) And it happens that you come to this place for "fun". Yeah, you play dice for drinks, very clever. And also you can go dance (again, lots of people, you can't barely move). Oh, and you can go to the WC. So what else can you actually do, when you're cuffed to your table, where there are only drinks and dice ?
-1 real fun

7) Meeting people. So, you wanna make it up with a girl. How can you judge on her appearance, look through all that make up and thouse one-meter heels? Only one thing guaranteed - you're gonna have a big surprise the next morning.
- 1 meeting people

8) Yes, you can still find some drunk girl for sex here. That's probably the only advantage of this place.
+1 sex
And at the same time it still depends on initial aim of going to the club and some luck.

The young people of every nationality go for it voluntarily, at their own wish. At the same time, as we just said, it doesn't help to meet new people, and isn't really fun.
I already got used to the fact that huge masses of people are totally wrong on something. The whole world is wrong on some aspects(like clubbing).

I still remember myself standing in the airport of Chengdu, waiting for the flight. I was standing close to the book store, there was a screen with a famouse and successful Chinese guy 李践, who was talking about how to make it in life, how to become successful.
And nobody was looking, nobody was listening.
