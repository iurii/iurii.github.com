p(meta). 3 June 2011 - Shenzhen

The first time I came to China was the 2nd of September 2008. It was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shouguang">Shouguang city</a>, Shandong province. I stayed there for 1.5 year till 24th of January 2010. Approximately 4 months in Ukraine to handle work visa issues, and on the 3rd of June I'm back to China. This time it's South - Shenzhen. So, a year has passed. What did I achieve ? Less then I could, but still:
1. Passed HSK 6 two times
2. Got episodic roles in two movies, one tv-drama, two tv-shows.

I broke heart of one of Chinese girls. I had no choice.
My heart was broken twice.
I shot my first <a href="http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMjY0MjYxMDAw.html">short film</a> (promo-video)
Started studying photography
Opened new blog in English (this one)
Learned couple of songs on piano

If you have a look at all this stuff, it's merely nothing. Daytime at the office, evening in the gym or at home reading books.
I met some good people.

Yesterday I bought myself the first real perfume in my life, which is Guerlain. Oh, and got some name cards, designed by a <a href="http://shenzhen.livejournal.com">friend</a> who worked in Lebedev studio.

One more thing. I never worked in the same company more than one year, hahahah. So, it's the first time I'm gonna work at the same place with the same people more than one year.
