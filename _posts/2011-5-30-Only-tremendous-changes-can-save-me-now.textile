p(meta). 30 May 2011 - Shenzhen

I feel I'm diving in somewhere. You may call it depression or anything else - it will be half thuth though. Because I'm very clear where the roots are. I'm stuck here in the city I know, in the city where nothing happens, in the job which is not interesting and doesn't allow me any personal growth, with no friends or girlfriends. I can't even make up my mind to go and pay 1500 RMB for 3 months of MMA-training, and that's what I love. But still, something is missing. I need to get out of here. New city, new people, I can't stop. Every day is the same, and there's no difference, and I can't live like a robot making myself believe it's the life I want, making myself believe that I'll spend some time learning Chinese and then someday somehow it will help me. It will, but I can't sit here waiting for something. Nothing will help me, be it alcohol,
long-term relations or promised Taikwando coach position. I need a tremendous change of career and location. Fresh up my brains, breath in fresh air. I have no idea where I'm going. I have no idea what I'm doing. But still need to follow my heart, and my heart lies in movies and acting. Bless me.
I realize only one thing - nothing happens if you don't make it happen. Moreover, things which happen to you without your control should at least be suspicious. So, I have no choice: either move further, either die in front the screen.
