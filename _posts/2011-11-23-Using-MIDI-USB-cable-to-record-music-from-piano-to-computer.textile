I installed Pianissimo - very easy to use software which allowed to record music from my Yamaha 3100 to my notebook using MIDI-USB cable.
The programm allows easy convertion to MIDI, WAV, MP3 formats, so I recommend it to everyone. For better sound quality I also recommend you to buy a better MIDI-USB cable (thanks, Captain Obvious).
