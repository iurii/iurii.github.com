One of advantages of shooting movies or any other stuff where you need to play someone, is that you can actually try something new - try a new profession, or a new adventure.
I experienced being worker, as well as a lost guy in the jungles. It's fun. Jackie Chan was saying the same thing: "When I'm on the screen, I can be anyone - a rich guy, a policeman, lawyer".
