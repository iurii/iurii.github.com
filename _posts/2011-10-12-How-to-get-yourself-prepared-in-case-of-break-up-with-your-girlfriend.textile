How to get yourself prepared in case of break up with your girlfriend.

Everybody knows what is it, when those memories flush into your brains, everything you had, including how she taught you what kind of milk to buy,
what kind of washing liquid to use. Your clothes, which you were once picking together, are still hanging in your wardrobe, and in the fridge there's still that candy she didn't ate up.
Yet there are some good ways to get back to your normal life:

1. <b>Preventive</b>. No matter what happens in your life, you need to stick to your plan.
Training drills, languages, all kind of interests you have. Never give up any of your hobby for a girl.
For example, business trip or even just a visit to the gym, in major cases are much more important then stupid shopping with your girlfriend.
Your interests and your way of behavior increase your self-esteem.

2. <b>Immediate</b>. Go somewhere, have some fun, talk to as many girls, as you can. You don't need to seduce each of them.
When you talk to interesting people, your horizons widen and you look at your situation more objectively.

3. <b>Advanced</b>. Learn to control your thoughts. Not the thoughts themselves, but their flow.
Sometimes a person wants to feel sorry about oneself, nostalgy comes, emotions, and all that results only in waste of your time and spirit.
This state of mind should be put aside, meanwhile it's better to think about more productive things like work, study, your plans.
Girls come and go, and you're always as you are, with everything you acquired through your life, with everything you know, or don't know, with everything you can, or can't do.

Your ways to overcome break-up or get yourself prepared are welcomed.
