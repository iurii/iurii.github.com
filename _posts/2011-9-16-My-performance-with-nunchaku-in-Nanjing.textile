So I went to participate in the press-conference of 中国达人秀 (China has talents) . It was generally a fail.
I had no stick, no table tennis balls(to hit them with nunchaku), so I had to make up the performance with nunchaku only. The music started too early, so I was late by a few seconds.
Inspite of all that I met some good people and learned new stuff, and I enjoyed the city of Nanjing. Awesome city with great culture and variaty of parks, places of interest, lakes.
