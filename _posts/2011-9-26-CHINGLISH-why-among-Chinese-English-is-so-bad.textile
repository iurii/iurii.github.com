A few more thoughts about CHINGLISH (Chinese English)

Why is it so awful ? Jackie Chan speaks with a very strong accent.
Millions of Chinese speak the same English, and you're lucky if it's as fluent, as Jackie Chan's.
Only very few people, after studying abroad, can be proud of their ideal English. And I have met these people.

So where's the problem ? For sure, it's not the problem of native speakers (though, many Chinese would think this way). Let's take Ukraine as an example - the city of Kiev.
Are there that many foreigners there ? Are there that many teachers of English among them ? Very few. Almost none.
How many good Ukrainian teachers of English went abroad, somewhere to Great Britain, or, say, USA ? How many of them were coached by native-speakers ?
You know the answer - most of good Ukrainian teachers of English never went abroad, and their English was studied on the territory of Ukraine, without help of native-speakers.

During my life in Ukraine I met very few people who were able to speak English without Russian accent. Though, in general, the situation was much better, than in China.
At this point I'm leaning to blame the education system of China. I once talked to a "teacher" of English, in Shouguang province, in a pretty wealthy third-tire city of Shouguang.
It was the most horrible Enligsh I ever heard in my life. And this man was teaching English to Chinese kids, being confessed that he has a good command of English.

As it always turns out, the problem is in skilled personnel. Taking Ukraine as an example, I can tell that one can learn good English without going abroad or talking to foreigners. As long as one has brains and a good teacher.

Now a few words about brains. I also know a guy, who never went to any kind of special English schools. He was watching movies in English for 5 years, reading scenario of each film. Now he has awesome prononciation. Without any coaches.

Thus, I see several key problems, which should be solved in order to increase the level of English among people of China:

1) Pay special attention to personnel. Education system, salaries of teachers, make them become more professional.
2) Make people realize how awful their prononciation is.
3) Once more, pay more attention to cadres. Let the majority of them be phonetics specialists.
4) Forget about laowai and native speakers, except those who are specialized in teaching English and have corresponding diplomas and knowledge.
I often hear a lot of unnecessary endings when Chinese speak. For example, in the word "ball" they add "r" sound, to make the word sound more softly. Sounds like "borr".
And this technique, as one of my Chinese friends said, was taught to them by a foreign teacher.

Let's face it, there's a lot of stuff in China going on, which is done for the show. The same is with native speakers, who often take teaching work not so seriously, just because they have no other way to earn money.
Chinese like to hire white teachers, even if their English is worse than Enlish of a Chinese person, who even studied abroad.
I have mixed feelings about that, recalling the phrase 出租白人 - meaning "white people for rent".

In the end there are only two main problems, which should be solved in China:

1) awareness of Chinese people 2) highly qualified cadres
