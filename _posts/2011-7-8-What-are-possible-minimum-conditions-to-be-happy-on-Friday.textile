p(meta). 8 July 2011 - Shenzhen

To have a dinner with Vietnamese girl on Thursday.
Go to movies with her and watch 武侠 with Donnie Yen(By the way, probably his worst movie ever)
Get a call from an agency aking you if you have time on Friday morning to shoot a promo-video for a factory.


Friday morning - shooting. Friday afternoon - workplace.
I probably shouldn't mention, that during the shooting, although it was pretty easy(I was playing a client, who came to a water-heater factory), I got lots of pleasure. I met new people, met a 18 y.o. girl from Poland, who works as a model since 13 years, travels a lot.
She wakes up at 4 AM and goes jogging. People say to her "Come on, you're young! You should enjoy life! Sleep more, go to parties, watch TV". Like me, she is interested in self-discipline.
All that happens during +33 C heat, in a distant district of Shenzhen, where it feels almost like the air is stuck and not moving in the rays of sun. It felt like you can push the air with your hand and it will move forward slowly.

My agent was reproaching me - I was trying to give people my name card, hahaha. And it's not permitted, because it's agency who found this job for me.
