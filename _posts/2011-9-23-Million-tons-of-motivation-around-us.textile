Lots of motivation here.
When I see a fat guy, I don't want to skip gym sessions anymore.
(I see another fat person in the shop, buying trillions of junk food)

When I see a person in glasses, I want to start excercising my eyes immediately.
(Plenty of people in China never take off their glasses)

When I see stupididy of masses, I want to think faster.
(For example, when shopping in a mall, you have to maneuver around those super-slow people)

When I see people who are not attentive, I want to always be focused.
(When riding my bike, I'm always 100% focused, always analyze the situation on the road. Once I almost bypass a person, I often hear exclamations and sighs. Once there was even a man who told me "be careful!". Like I myself am not interested in avoiding the dangerous situation on the road. I see them in a mile, they don't see me in a meter. Now I understand how people get in car accidents.)

When I see people with zero reaction, I always want to react fast.
(Standing on the red light, it sometimes takes as much as several seconds for most of them to find out it's green light already)

When I see lazy people, I want to do something useful immediately. Something for myself.
(People change coins and go to play games, spending both money and time).

When I see poor people, I want to become rich. 
(I see a "beggar" who has hands, but does nothing useful. Just asks for money)

When I see the way most office workers walk, I can see them in their old age: even more weak walk pace with bended backbone.
(People do absolutely nothing. No sports. If I still can see old people practicing Taiji in the mornings, that's good. At the same time I see no young people. The same is about gyms where most of the visitors are people over thirty.)
