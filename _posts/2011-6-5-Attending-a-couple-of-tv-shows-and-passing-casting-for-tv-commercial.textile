p(meta). 5 June 2011 - Shenzhen

Recently I've applied for a lot of shows on different web-sites and via phone. Couple of days ago I got a call from a Shenzhen TV studio, they said I can come and watch the show, called “年代秀”. Sure thing, being a viewer and a guest - is totally different. Sitting in the audience, you couldn't get any chances of getting noticed. But at least I got a chance to enter the tv studio and make some new friends, learn something new. Better then nothing.

On Friday I had to get off work 1 hour earlier, had to get permission of my boss. Surprisingly，he said "it it urgent？“. To make it clear, there are 3 days off in China, it's 端午节，I'm asking of ONE HOUR, knowing that there are no urgent tasks on the projects, and he says "well, could you stay?". I ask him "what do you mean?". Because it really sounded shocking for me. I mean, it's FRIDAY, HOLIDAYS, and I'm asking only for one hour，which will be DEDUCTED from my salary. 
He said "you ask for days off too often". LOL. Another shocking phrase from a mister GOD-BOSS, who, as it seems, has rights to judge whether someone has been asking for day off too often. In my case, I had to go to police twice (visa stuff, not my fault) and to see the doctor. Each time took like one hour. And now he says it's too much, though, there are no fucking reasons to let me stay and "work" during that poor last Friday hour. I was very strict with him, though, didn't cross the line of politeness and work etiquette. He gave me that hour so I could go to the show. 
To make it even more stupid, his fellow-townsman, the same bootlicking type of person, the php-developer, who's sitting on the right, said "Wow! Leaving so early!". Add a stupid fake smile on his face and you got that coctaile of worst possible features of a person.

So, I went to the show as an ordinary viewer. Before the shooting we had a free dinner. Awww, so sweet of them. They'd have to shoot the whole thing from 8 PM to midnight, so they needed to get people fed up.

I sat on the last row, as there were no free seats, but then the director noticed me, said I shout good, and that I'm very active, so she let me sit in the first row. A few moments later she gave a chance for anyone to go out and make a joke. One Chinese guy went out, and said something not really funny. I prepared to pass the opportunity, but hey, why did I go to the show? So I took my word and everybody were happy to hear a joke from a laowai(=foreigner) :D

So, I got noticed, and it made me feel better. There were a lot of famous Chinese actresses and stars on the show, so it was quite a good chance to feel the atmosphere of being a public person. The shooting finesed at 1:00 AM. Everybody were tired, I took some pictures and went home on a taxi, which we shared with one of SZ TV photographers.

Next day they let me drop by once more. I made some pics, made some more friends. Really nice time. I even had a chance to say some words about the tv show on the camera. They finished shooting the 年代秀's last part (part 10, as I remember) and will have a one month rest. Hope to see them soon.

By the way, yesterday, during Saturday, I passed a casting for a commercial. There were 7 models (girls) and me - the only guy. The funny part is that they turned out the models, because they didn't fit my height - they were too high. The guy who picked the models said： "Show me your biceps". I did, and that was it. The easiest casting on my memory, hahaha.

Looking forward to all new stuff which is coming to my life.
