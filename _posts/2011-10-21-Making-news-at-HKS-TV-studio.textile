I love everything about TV, shooting, movies and the stuff, so I was lucky to get to the <a href="http://www.hkstv.tv/">HKSTV</a> studio and witness the process of making news by myself.

I'd like to mention, that being a TV host is a hard work. Not as easy, as lots of people mistakenly think. Not to mention that sometimes you have to get up at 4-5 AM, not to mention high pressure and responsibility. Sometimes you have to sleep in the studio.

During make-up, the tv host usually reads the script, to get familiar with the topics she's going to talk about.

The white sheet of paper is used to adjust the camera.

All set, start the broadcast!

It sometimes takes several shots to get the result we seen on the TV screen.

Then you need to do some post-processing of the footage.

When everything is done, everyone can go home.
