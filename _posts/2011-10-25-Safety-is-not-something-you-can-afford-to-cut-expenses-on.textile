For example these new safety lights for my beloved Haro - they cost couple of bucks. Yet they add a lot to your safety during night riding. One could actually come up with a bunch of good examples of unworthy money saving, which causes potential danger:

1) Walking in the night through suburbs, instead of taking taxi
2) Getting yourself new tires, instead of saving money on using old ones
3) Buying yourself a new door with a good lock, instead of hoping noone will break in
4) Saving money on high-quality healthy food, instead of spending money and time on doctors
5) Buying yourself health security, rather than in case of emergency have no money for doctors.

Actually I also changed my brakes and fixed the one on the rear, which appeared to be totally broken. Now I have this awesome feeling of riding the bike and being the king of the road.
