Why it's damn hard to shoot people in Hong Kong:
1) The pace of life in HK is way too fast. Everybody is rushing.
2) Too many people, hard to find suitable background.

I hunted for this girl deliberately. First I found a suitable background, and than just waited.
The idea of waiting instead rushing like everybody else didn't come at once to my mind. Now I get that this activity is very similar to fishing.
