p(meta). 8 August 2011 - Shenzhen

From general to details:<br /><br />
1) Surprisingly, girs in Chengdu are prettier than girls in other cities of China. In general.<br />
2) Another surprise - the tits of Chengdu girls are bigger too.<br />
3) Local food was awesome, comparable to Changsha's, which is still at the first place for me.<br />
4) It's damn hard to catch a taxi in Chengdu. Almost impossible at daytime. It's В Чэнду сложно поймать такси. Днем - вообще нереально. <br />
5) Chengdu's pase of life is slower than Shenzhen's. Thus is feels more comfortable.<br />
6) Chengdu's teahouses are sacret places for relaxation and forgetting everything in this world<br />
7) Night clubs in Chengdu are awesomely cool. Even people from Shanghai say that Shanghai clubs are not as cool as those in Chengdu.<br />

Chengdu's teahouse.<br /><br /><b>27th of July. Wednesday.</b><br />
<br />Take off should be at 10:20, but the plane was dalayed for 40 mins. Yet we did it in time. Passengers were still behaving like babies. Idiots. We landed in Chengdu at 13, where I and another Chinese guy who was on the same flight, were met and taken to the hotel.
<br /><br />We were hanging out there, till the rest participants of the show - guys from Beijing and Shanghai arrived. The had some friends in Chengdu - two girls, so we went out to have some dinner with them.
They were guiding us around Chengdu, using their own cars, and that was very nice of them.
I must notice, that there is plenty of rich people in Chengdu. There's one club where entrance only costs 30-40 thousand RMB. Some people say even Jackie Chan likes to go there from time to time.
After dinner we came back to hotel, where we met the director and talked about the show.
br /><br />The scheme was easy: there are 40 girls. Computer picks 8 of them based on your parameters. Then during the show you pick the one and only one you like. Sure thing, during the show they ask you
questions and you ask them questions, so that you can know each other better.
If the girl has doubts about you, she lights the bulb in red light.

During the show I used my harp for several seconds and played with nunchaku(so-so), and 5 of 8 girls turned me out, which was really unexpected. I know I'm good! Hahahah.
<br /><br />The show itself we were shooting on the 3rd day.<br /><br /><br />
<b>On the 28th of July, Thursday</b>I had nothing to shoot, so we went to the city with the girls, and in the evening went to the club.
<br /><br /><b>29th of July</b> in the morning we had our make-up at 10 o'clock. At 11 we arrived to the tv-studio.
Back then I didn't know that my turn would come up only at 00:00 in the midnight. We were 6 guys, started shooting at 14:00, the first part took the longest time as they had to set
up the lights, and the devices had some problems.<br /> We were hanging around in the make-up room. Sometimes we couldn't go out, because there were girls outside - attendants of the same show.
According to rules we're not allowed to see each other before the show.
Sometimes we were talking to tv hosts, sometimes we were just sleeping and saving energy for the show.
I met our tv host, who came from Beijing. He was about to turn 50, yet looked much younger and fit. He told me he watched my profile and predicted 2011 year will be a very good one for me.
Especially Oktober-November - I will have a chance, and I should be ready no grasp it no matter what.
At 00:00 it was my turn to go to the show. 5 of 8 girls turned me down. Then there left only two of them - a nice girl and a scary boss. Sure thing I picked the nice one. It was sad to find out later that she's got no feelings to me, and might even have a boyfriend.
<br /><br />30-rd of July we were walking together with my new Shanghaineese friend Ken, who succeed on the show. And "my" girl was too shy and seemed to be pretty cold about me.
The same night we went to the club, where I met another girl. Actually, some Chinese girls got drunk and were literally hanging on my neck.
<br /><br />31-rd of July was the last day in Chengdu. I was hanghing around the town with folks from the other episode of the same show.
The flight was at 18:20.<br /><br />Climate in Chengdu is better than in Shenzhen, but still the sky was grey all the time we were there.

Good old ancient Chengdu. The way the city looked long long ago (without the firetruck, sure thing)<br /><br />
