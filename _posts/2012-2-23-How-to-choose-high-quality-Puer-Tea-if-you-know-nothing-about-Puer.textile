Only during the 4th year in China I consciously tasted Puer.

It has many names - Pu'er, Pu-erh, Puer, Po Lei or even Bolay. Legendary tea, having a lot of talks and stories circulating around it. After the first sip of tea I expected that I'd become more powerful, just like Popeye. I took several more sips, tasting the 2nd and 3rd brew - still nothing. Then I was given a bit cheaper variety of Puer, and I felt the difference in aftertaste. Then they gave me to taste some expensive Puer, which price was several hundreds yuan and I felt like an emperor. After couple of hours of drinking Puer on an empty stomach I felt diggy and my sight grew dim.

It turns out, the longer you keep Puer, the better it becomes, and, correspondingly, the higher its price. Thus, you might buy some Puer, put it in some safe place, come back in 10-20 years, and become rich. Especially expensive kinds of Puer, which price may go up to thousands or even tens of thousands yuan are not kept in the shop. They're kept at safe place, out of harm's way.

My paradigm of TEA consisted only of black and green tea. Now there's one more, which is Puer, yet I still can't say the difference between wulong and green tea. In either way, I wasn't buying tea for myself, because I haven't yet come to that point of conscious and deliberate drinking of different kinds of tea, with the purpose of tasting them, clicking my tongue and clever gaze in the window. For now I'm just gettin some green stuff, thorow it in the cup, add some boiling water. Readiness can be checked by the burn on my tongue.
The recipe for a good tea is simple - don't be greedy for brew.
