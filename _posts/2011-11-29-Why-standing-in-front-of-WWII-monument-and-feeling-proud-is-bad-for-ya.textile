The picture is taken from <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9F%D0%B0%D0%BC%D1%8F%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B8_%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%BC%D1%83_%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B4%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%83" target="_blank">wikipedia</a>.

All these monuments should be unified, or better, they should all have the same look, for example - stupid donkey face. This donkey face would depict stupidity of human race, which indeed
deserves building lots of monuments all over the world. Done that, the process of recognition of historical facts would go more smoothly, and the most important - it would go in right direction.

What we got now - a monument to an unknown soldier. People come by, put flowers, the heart is full of feelings and sorrow. You even start feeling proud for the soldier in particular, and for
your motherland in general - good job, sons! You've done hard work, survived and won. In fact all these monuments are built by the government - not for the fallen, but to unite people, so that it would
be more easy to control them and send to the next war.
Monuments, which should be built - monuments to poets, artists, creators. Yet today we are still worshiping the destroyers, even they are natives.

P.S. If you like watching war films (which I do), it means you like fairy tales. Yet fairy tales are only tales, no matter how interesting they are, and how much you want to believe in them.
