With some random beauty in Jerusalem near the Wailing Wall

1) There's a whole bunch of nationalities in Israel: Russians, French, Jews, Arabs, Americans and others. You walk along the street and think to yourself - What are you all doing here? Go home! You can often hear Russian speach.
2) Too little people in the streets. Those of you who've been to China will understand.
3) The cars are pretty simple. It's because the tax for imported cars is huge (70%) and the prices for gas are even higher than in Canada.
4) More fat people than in China, yet less, than in Ukraine.
5) Israelis and Arabs are pretty emotional. It only adds the colour when you see some Arab girl shouting and quarelling in the street.
6) There are lots of green trees and parks in Israel. Every tree has got a pipe near it for watering.
7) Sometimes you can bump into a very hot girl. "Sometimes" because you don't see much people outside.
8) People are generally more positive (maybe only except Russians).
9) Billboards, ads, business cards, even Google - everything is in Hebrew and is written from right to left.
10) Not that much people speak English. More than in China, of course, yet not as much, as I thought. It might be because all the Israeli who speak good English are busy in their offices or riding their cars, so that you don't have a chance to meet them in the street. I don't imagine, how one can live in Israel without knowing Hebrew. All the signs, train station announcements - everything is in Hebrew.
