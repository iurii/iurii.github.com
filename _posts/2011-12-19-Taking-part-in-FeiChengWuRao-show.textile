The good thing is that during the show I was able to bring up the topics
of having serious look at work, yet not working and pretending you're working,
inability of people to relax, and, well, some of that was cut, but hey.
Among all of the 24 girls I liked very few. Girl #22 is pretty, kind and honest, so I picked her.
Didn't know it's she who has children. Anyway, I'm even glad that nobody chose me.
