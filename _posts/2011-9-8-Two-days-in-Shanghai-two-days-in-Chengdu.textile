p(meta). 8 September 2011 - Shenzhen

I was told not to take part in the contest for 中国达人秀 show in Shanghai, and instead will probably go to Nanjing next week. So I just went to Shanghai to see my friends.
I was back to Shenzhen on Sunday evening, and after only 4 hours of sleep was on my way to Chengdu (7:30 morning flight) to take part in the show 《欢喜来逗阵》.
That same day in the evening I had a rehearsal, the same was next day.
I did my job, and I did it pretty fine. Though, I found out there were some issues with technique and my general understanding of the show itself.

- Hard to concentrate on movements, because you have to listen to music to know when to change the weapon (nunchaku, stick)
- Hard to work with nunchaku, as the clothes was not suitable for that
- The stage was pretty small, haven't had much space to move
- Limited time. I forgot to make some stuff and so it's gone as there's no stuff
- Of course, being a bit nervous. Though, must admit, I do a good job in that direction and barely become nervous
- The song I learned and practiced was in a different tone, so I had to relearn it in a C key in one day.

After the show I felt super-tired. Yet super-happy, as hard job was over and I did my best, though, I should do better.
At least now I know what is 90 sec performance and what I will encounter during next performances.

Once again I come to a point where I realize, that I need to became a creator of short films. With fight scenes.
The next day after the show I had an early plane to Shenzhen, and went to job immediately, where I was told if I go on asking for leave too ofthen, I would be fired.
They even wanted me not to go to the 中国达人秀 contest. Yeah, sure, waste once in a life-time chance for an opportunity to become a "good and obedient worker".
