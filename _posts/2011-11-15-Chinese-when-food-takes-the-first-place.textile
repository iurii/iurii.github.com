I've been living in China for almost 3 years. Instead of summarizing my experience and making pretty obvious conclusion, that most Chinese care about money and food only, I want to share with you examples from my own life:

<b>Three questions, which I was asked, when registering at a Chinese dating website.</b>
1) Can you cook ?
2) Do you eat spicy food ?
3) Which dish is your favourite ?

Sure, why to ask about inner world, hobbies, interests - let's lay off these boring topics for a while. First we need to think of things with "A" priority - FOOD! It's very reasonable to do so, because in case you and your future wify eat different food, you might even never make it up together.

<b>Status of one of Chinese colleagues in a messenger:</b>
你吃，或者不吃零食，大脸就在那里，不悲不喜；你喝，或者不喝可乐，腰围就在那里，不来不去；你跑，或者不跑步，体重就在那里，不增不减；你减，或者不减肥，肉就在你身上，不舍不弃；来脂肪的怀里，或者，让胖子住进别人的心里，默然想吃，忍住，纠结，泪崩！

My translation:
It doesn't matter if you eat a snack, your fat big cheeks are there, no sorrow and no joy.
It doesn't matter if you drink Cola, or don't drink - your waist's the same, not more, nor less.
It doesn't matter if you run, or not, your weight is all the same - not more, not less.
It doesn't matter if you liked the fat one, or being fat yourself,
Deep inside your soul, you wants to eat, and suffer severe pain...
There are only doubts left and tears - you'll break, my God, you will!

<b>Morning talk of Chinese and Russian colleagues via messenger:</b>
Most: 我这边有一条鱼死了. 我刚才抓鱼去了 那条鱼有病了
Most卡佳: 有病了还是死了？
Most: 有病了 估计快要死了。一会过来看看啊
Most卡佳: 不要。 谢谢
Most: 说到鱼  我想起鱼子酱了。。。。

My translation:
Chinese: we've got a dead fish here. I just fished it out. Seems to be ill.
Kate: So is it dead or ill ?
Chinese: It's ill, but seems it's gonna die soon. Come by, have a look.
Kate: No, thanks.
Chinese: Ohh, as we started talking about fish, I immediately recalled that awesome and delicious caviar...

I'm scared of all that. Today in the morning I met a Chinese friend. Her first words were: "Damn I'm so hungry, did you have your breakfast?". I have a feeling that people think of nothing else except food. It's so contradicting - they build awesome parks, shoot deeply touching movies and write very good music, but in general the nation thinks only about food. From this angle of view the choice of Chinese wife becomes a big question.
