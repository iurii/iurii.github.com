How to answer the most stupid questions in the world ? Well, it's pretty straightforward. Don't say a word. Make a serious look into eyes of the person, untill the dumbass realises the stupidity and irrelevance of the questinon. If the dumbass goes on asking you unreasonable questions, you should make even more serious look, and look into his eyes with even more meaning. Don't blink or take away your eyes. Your look should make the person feel embarrassed, wronged, discouraged. 

Why play fool's rules games ? Why waste your time ? You might get dumb like that. If you talk to an idiot and you don't crack jokes on him, don't gibe at him, or use any other way of conscious protection, you might become dumb too. As a protection against dumbass idiots I love to use my acting skills, so that it makes me laugh almost like when I'm watching Jim Carrey's movies, or else I make a very serious and discouraging look, don't say a word so that even an idiot can get what I mean.

Couple of days ago our Chinese colleague asked our Russian colleague the following question: "Hey, Kate, what kind of facing tile do Russians like ?". You can't answers this totally irrelevant, absulutely unreasonable question, which probably origined from some random abyss of chaos. This question is beyond reason and logic and is at the most top, meaning you can't beat it. Any other counter-question would be ranked lower, than this question, so there's no way you can win. And loosing to a fool always hurts. You can't play their rules. It's a matrix, which fools you and tries to make you think using Chinese logic. The chance to make a fool realise he has done something stupid tends to zero, because in order to understand that he needs brains, so you'd better not even start. You have right to ignore shit. Shit-filter, spam-filter - call it as you wish, you can have it. To make it work you have to practice saying "no". You are not obligated to react on any sort of shit coming towards you, even if it's of friendly nature.
