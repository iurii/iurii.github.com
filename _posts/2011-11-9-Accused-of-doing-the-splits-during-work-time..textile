I've been accused of leaning to the back of my chair during work (I'm supposed to sit straight), as well as accuesed of doing the splits during the on-line audio call. Besides, I've been accused of not being nervous during work - meaning, I'm not worried enough, not running all around the office searching for solution of another problem of the Universe. The fact that I'm doing my job, and doing it diligently - is secondary. The key point is that it should LOOK like I'm striving for the company. Jokes during work time, of course, are not welcomed. If you're making a joke of your Chinese boss - you're doomed. Walk straight, don't talk, don't laugh during work time, do what you were told. Don't think. That's the ideal worker. When I was writing these words, our HR was slowly passing by, looking at our facial expressions. Our faces should express total concentration, deep concern, absorbtion in work, and then you are a "good worker". At the same time, interacting with my Ukrainian boss envolves only positive emotions.
