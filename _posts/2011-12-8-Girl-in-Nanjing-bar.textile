I met her in one of those bars with soft music (清吧), after recording the 非诚勿扰 tv show. Pretty girl, smart, likes fashion.

I walked to the bar manager and asked if I can play some piano. The answer was "yes", so I played for her and for myself. When I was playing Numb - Linkin Park, one of musicians came buy and started improvising. It was so fun playing together. I felt that people care, that people listen to different music, and that they are open.

It was the first time I played piano in a bar. 26th of November.
