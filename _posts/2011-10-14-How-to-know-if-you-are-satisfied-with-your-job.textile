If you dream of Friday when Monday not even started - then your job is not for you. You don't belong there.
The more general formula sounds like that: if you think only about the result - the thing which you're doing wasn't meant to be done by you. This thing just doesn't belong you. It's you, who belongs to this thing. The thing is doing you. But why, why you still doing it?

There are some misleading concepts involved. For example: "What doesn't kill me - makes me stronger."
I'll translate it's meaning: "I eat shit, so I become stronger" (quite a contradictory conclusion, I'd say).

It's all similar to Christianity: I suffer and it's good. I suffer and I become someone better than I was before bla bla bla. It's all similar to "No pain - no gain". After all these brainwashing proverbs and sayings people start to think that "bad" is actually "good". Well, it is to some point, when you try to be optimistic and it works! When you spilled the coffee on your pants and went to the WC you bumped into a cute girl. You got her number and totally forgot about the coffee and the pants.
But what if we try to think big? (c)

When you actually say that "bad" is "good", aren't you cheating yourself? Why would you want to suffer, If lifetime is already too short? You simply don't have time to suffer. You have to be fucking happy every day.
But you still go on doing dumb things like going to dumb work, dating a creepy girl or attending boring lectures in university. <b>Doing everything by inertia</b>.

<b>So, let me classify two types of shit</b>:
1. The shit you eat voluntarily. It's even delicious so you won't even call it "shit".
For example: when a year ago I was getting up at 5:00 AM, studying Chinese, wushu, attending several lectures on Chinese(my love) , launch, again several lectures and a training and so on so on I was very tired. One might think it was shit that I basically never hang out and all my life back than consisted of study and work outs. Surprisingly I was very happy. I ate it voluntarily.

2. The shit you are fed. It's the shit you don't need, don't want, don't like, but you eat it because someone feeds it to you. And there are even no vitamins in it (no benefits at all).

I suspect there are a lot of people eating shit type #2 and thinking they're on the right way.
They have lot's of excuses "There, there, just keep up, wait a year or two and everything will become fine".
This approach works when you have no choice. Many people use this approach. But when there are new opportunities - the people are already closed. Got used.
If you ask them what's wrong and why aren't they moving forward, If they could hear their inner voice, they'd say: "<b>I'm doing everything by inertia</b>". And it would be true. But they usually can't judge the situation objectively, so they say "Well, I don't know, I've been doing it for <b>N-years</b>...". Nice excuse.

So, do you think of Friday? Are you constantly thinking of Friday? Some day there will come your last Friday.
Let's wait together, or let's enjoy Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and, yes, Friday. Now it's your call.
