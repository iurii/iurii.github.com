I don't know about other countries, yet in China it's a very common thing - to stand in a line at ATM. Sometimes you have to stay for 20-30 minutes because of some rich punk.
Those who've been in China for a while, should probably have spotted those mysterious, yet admirable people with shoulder bags.
These people can stand at one ATM for 15-20 minutes, taking cash from 10-20 bank cards.
Today I already managed to spot one of those "rich" guys:

1. The line behind him is not moving
2. Shoulder bag on the shoulder
3. His actions are fast and professional
4. It looks like he's in a hurry
5. Standing unseemly close to the ATM
6. Staying hours at the ATM using hundreds of cards to get trillions of cash.

What should you do ? First you need to line up to another ATM, and don't forget to make sure that it's not already occupied with another "rich" guy. Once I was just lucky enough to spot two of them and made right decision on picking the right line.

Sometimes, when there are too many billionaires at the ATM, you can simply ask one of them: "Pal, how many cards you've got there?". Pal will give an answer, and you will be able to make right decision on whether to stay in the line, or try your luck in another line. There are also good moments in standing and waiting in those endless lines - when there's only one ass standing between you and the sacred blue screen, and it goes and goes drawing out the money, your ability to tolerate and forgive rises to the skies. I personally pumped my level of patience to level 8. Further pumping is possible only with the help of magic artefacts, rabbit paw and a four-leaf clover.
