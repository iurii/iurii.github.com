It's been a while. I was busy with all those show preparations, as well as going to the show itself and enjoying the legendary Chengdu for 5 days.
I'm going to write a fresh update on my recent shooting activities later, so now you can just enjoy this pic. It's the girl who I picked on the love show in Chengdu.
Still she's too traditional, as it seems, and she believes I'm too western, so I really don't know what's gonna work of that. Still, at least good memories.
