For those of you who might consider if it's fun to live abroad.
It's tough to live abouad. Morally. So, before moving abroad, you'd better think twice and consider all pros and cons - it's like with Chinese language. Either you go for a long play(at least for a couple of years), or you'd better not waste your time. Because there's no way you gonna go out dry out of the water.

Being in Ukraine - my motherland, I could live in my own flat, eat what there is in fridge, freely attend job interviews, knowing that getting a good well-paid job is just a matter of one-two weeks. Yet here, abroad - everything is different. Your job - is your visa and your accomodation. No job - no visa, and no flat. In other words, your basic necessities are threatened. If you get into fight, you might be deported to your country, and your passport is your only protection. And yet even with the passport you can't go to computer club, because they accept only Chinese ID cards. On the same reason even getting a room for a night would be a problem for a foreigner, as the majority of hotels accept Chinese ID cards only.

So it's like being constantly and invevitably pressured, when you must go to work, not only to pay bills, but at least to have visa. At this point let's add Chinese, who are totally different, totally different country with it's own culture, where no one expected you coming. We are in their home here, not in our's, as lots of expats would like to think. Sure thing, you feel yourself here more at home, than in your motherland, yet all the differences are still too striking.
Every time, when you find yourself thinking you're at home - have a look around, if there is no glare at your back from some Chinese guy, full of numbness, as if he's not capable of solving some puzzle, like WHO IS THAT (meaning YOU). What are you doing here and why the hell did you come here ? This glare, which you can't fight. This glare, which neglects all your good Chinese or friendly attitude towards Chinese.

And all that is taking place in the country with, perhaps, the most friendly people on Earth.
Let's not forget about vacuum - no friends, no family. There's no kitchen, where you'd sit with your dad, drinking slowly your morning coffee and talking about life, or just pick a topic and think. There are no traditional bathrooms, where you can dive into nice hot water, which would make you forget everything.
Suppose you - being well educated and open-minded person, will be constantly trying to find clues to understand Chinese mentality, it would be too naive on your side to think, that they will ever try to understand you. At least a little bit. For them - you're just another stupid and rich foreigner, who should be cheated if there's a chance.
Thus, your loneliness would be greater than in your motherland. There will be only a rhythm - do more before work, do more during work, do more after work, don't think too much before you go to bed, to gain some time.

In China job hunting always comes along with visa problems. Not speaking of the list of positions which is limited, and, sure thing, you'd better know Chinese.
So you just get into this strange world, with their rules, where you can't that easily find a job, or friends, or even at least a little bit open-minded Chinese girl. From any perspective, there will be no support, except your belief in yourself.

I believe, the main advantage of going abroad - is to throw yourself against the wall, letting the strike crash all your illusions and mistaken views concerning this world. And with every strike, let more and more pieces of crashed illusions fall down to the ground. Say good-bye to all of the stuff, you were diligently putting up together in your head during years. Face your naked being and be born again. Survive and get what you want.
