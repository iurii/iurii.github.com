It took a couple of days for preparations, and we shot the film in two days (13-14 July). Most of the scenes were shot outside, when the tempreture was going up to 35-40 degrees. Today I'm going to the studio to record voice and that's it. The film will be ready in a couple of days and will take part in a shorts competition of Guangdong province.
