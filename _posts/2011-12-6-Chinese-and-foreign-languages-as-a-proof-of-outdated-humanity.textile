Sometimes I have a feeling that I already gave up the thought of being able to learn Chinese. Today I was checking the vocabulary to see how to write 漂亮 (beautiful), and 幽默 (humor). During the briefing before shooting 非诚勿扰 show, there was a Chinese guy, who passed the selection, meaning he was good at expressing his thoughts and is capable of reasonable talking. And what do I hear ? "Damn, I forgot how to write in Chinese!". In the end, I filled the form faster than he did, though I was constantly using my phone to look for characters.

Chinese language - is protection of Chinese against the whole world. Everyone, who came to China, was totally absorbed by it. Even Dashan, who seems to have won the war with Chinese, became Chinese himself. On one hand, I am, sure thing, angry at Chinese, for them having in 21st century such an outdated language, and I have a feeling that they did it on purpose, like inability for a foreigner to get a cheap hotel for a night, or an internet-club. On the other hand, I observe hundreds of guys like me. They're in the sea, floating on some wreckage. That wreckage is of their year and a half of Chinese classes and myths about China. I see my co-worker, who's been studying Chinese for 7 years now. His Chinese is awesome, and audition is perfect. Yet he still says he doesn't know Chinese.

It's an endless war. Yet Chinese should be learnt to survive the shipwreck. Plenty of loosers in the sea, who think they know Chinese, or think "it's enough". Learning Chinese - is an awesome opportunity to learn firmness and bravety, so that not to be scared of reality, which consists of thousands of characters, proverbs, phrases, all sort of new words, almost identical characters, which have totally different meaning. On the top of that let's add dozens of local accents, called "putonghua", yet grating on ear so much, that you literally want to run away somewhere over the corner and turn on Chinesepod, and enjoy that correct putonghua, which exists in theory only.

Speacking the truth, the majority of Russians in China - are refugees. And I'm among them. If anyone with excited puppet-like eyes would ask me if he/she should learn Chinese or not, I'd firmly say: "no. under any circumstances don't do it". It's not games, it's not German.

One more important factor - time. It would be ideal to spend at least 8 hours per day for about 3-4 years, or more to learn Chinese, the more is better. If you think of learning Chinese after work when you have free time, you'd better give up this idea. Because in order to have results, you'd have to give up everything else. One more thing - you should learn Chinese to let Chinese know - they are wrong. What kind of nation you are to have such an outdated language ? Other languages, are, in fact, not better, beging overly complicated as well. Seems people are too slow, yet technologies are too fast. It's obvious that having different languages - is totally stupid idea. Stupid idea from the point of view of effeciency - just think of how much time you have to spend to master several different languages to be able to communicate with people to get information you want.

Though, there are some attempts - like teaching children outdated English. Which has no results - as I see it being in China.

Having that many languages overall characterizes citizens of planet Earth as highly irrationable beings. Learning Chinese - is like installing outdated web browser on your computer (By the way, more than 70% of Chinese internet users use IE6). There's a joke: "Optimists learn English, pessimists learn Chinese, realists learn AK-47". The joke is wrong. Pessimists will never be able learn Chinese.

One more misunderstanding. A lot of people started learning Chinese because China is at the front edge now, the economy is blooming, even the crisis seemed to have no impact on economy of China, the red flag hovers over the sky, high-tech is here, electro-mobiles are coming and so on. It's all just for the show. Only one glance at Chinese language would be enough, to get clear understanding of the stage of development of the country. Look at these thousand-year characters, and you will understand that today China is ahead only because it is its turn now. Cheap labour, having job from rich guys from USA and Europe and internal market. Look into windows of AUDIs, which pass by, you'll see uncultured people. Sometimes it seems like there's a monkey driving the car. You don't have to be a prophet to understand that shouting over the phone, even spitting wowen - is not something casual. Like scaring evil spirits with petards. China's been given a seat at a moder fighter plane, so it looks like progress and high-tech future all the way. Yet the pilot is someone, who two days ago was flying agriculturial aeroplane, spraying pesticides over the field. Europe is in shock, Americans are depressed, Chinese don't realise what's happened, yet just in case they keep shouting communist songs.

My diagnose: we're still in the stone age. Technologies didn't make us humans. Aliens sigh with sorrow. The hamster was given a slingshot, yet it doesn't know what to do with it. I will go on playing this stupid game. Have to play by the rules. Learning Chinese - is as stupid as learning any foreign language, yet in more expressed way, as you, being in conscious mind are ready to learn totally outdated and obsolete language, which is alive only because of inertia of masses, fear and stupidity of rulers, who have no foresight. In general, any foreign language - is like a car with different operating principle. Gear is somewhere in the seiling, some hoe is instead of the steering wheel, engine launches not with the key, yet with a little earthquake. Any foreign language - is like a local mobile operator. No card - no calls. Meaning it's totally stupid.

In the ending. If you, dear reader, can speak only 1-2 languages, you'd better not get comfortable with that. Learning languages - is stupid, but speaking only one outdated language is definitely much worse than speaking two or more outdated languages. So you have to learn languages, as we live in the age of not standardized OS, browsers, languages. Put your life for humanity being undeveloped. Just imagine how much stuff you could do instead of learning languages.

P.S. I'm tolerant about races. If you feel abused or hurt, feel free to interchange words "Chinese" with "Russian" or "Neanderthal". The point of this post is not in being racy, but to once again stress the fact that humanity is too outdated.

P.S. In fact, it's a good proof that technologies were sent to us by aliens. Anarchy, wars, drugs, languages - thinking beings, posessing technologies allowing them to fly to the Moon wouldn't allow all this shit to happen. On behalf of all citizens of planet Earth, I say "thank you" to aliens for all those awesome and cool technologies, as if 3 y.o. baby would thank his parents for a new computer.
