I didn't expect to see ducks in Israel, not to mention lakes or trees. I thought Israel is a complete desert.

Taking into consideration the fact, that in Israel there are way too many beauties per square meter, I feel terribly sorry for all those Jews, who had been killed by Nazi during World War II.
In fact, I think German girls are not that pretty (as someone who haven't yet been to Germany may think).
Sure thing, after experiencing Israel I didn't want to come back to China. I was thinking "Why, why, why, oh why am I coming back?". Maybe I'm just too sensitive, yet today's "spitting-war", when I heard people spititng loudly on the right flanc and on the rear, and it went for
about 10 seconds, I was ready to commit a crime. Maybe It was just that type of days when everyone around drives you nuts. Everything depends on perception, though.
