I was playing an American - resigned soldier who found a decent job as a security guard in one of museums of Washington. Then lot's of creapy things happen to him, similar to the movie "Night at the Museum" starring Ben Stiller. 
<br />
<b>Why shooting 4D movie is different:</b><br/>
1) When shooting - two cameras are used simultaneously. Equipment is from Germany, costs about one million dollars. <br />
2) Absence of other characters. I had to imagine mummies, rats, dinosaurs and soldiers of Terracotta Army, acting correspondingly.<br />
3) Minumum number of items. Only gun, machinegun, bazooka, flashlight and torch were real. I had to imagine the objects which were flying in my direction,
making sure that my eyballs track the trajectory. Doors and corridors were marked with green boxes. <br />
4) All the distances and angles - from camera to the actor, or to the item, the angle of the camera are written down in a special notebook. This data
will be used later, when adding computer graphics. <br />
5) It usually takes a year and above to complete the movie from scratch. Dozens of people are working on the graphics. In our case we already had the engine,
so it will take about 6-7 months to finish the movie. <br />
6) The slow-motion effect was created right on the spot. I was slowly trowing up the barrel, making it look like slow-motion, then adding speed and vice-versa.
<br />
Our interpreter. Happily, I can speak Chinese, so there was no need to use interpreter, we were shooting faster.

Cameraman, like an angel in the sky. There were 3 of them.

Oh, the table and the armchair were real too.

First I trained with real tennis balls, then with imaginary.

Pandas nailed me to the wall using bamboo spears.

All these green walls are very light, you can't lean against them, so there were comrades to prop them up.

The girl on the left is an actress and a dancer, yet very modest.

Before and after shooting the scene all the distances and angles are measured.

Fighting with green men. When I was a kid, me and my bro had a cassette with "Space Jam" on it, starring Michael Jordan.
I don't remember why, but we were wathing that film everyday for about a month. Would I ever think of myself shooting something
with green men in 15 years from then?

Some of my skills were very helpful. Acrobatics for better falls and dancing for better relaxation of body.

Two sreens for two cameras.

The red tapes will allow to add fire using computer graphics. The same red tapes were sticked to the flashlight, which will make it more easy to point the direction of ray.

Action!

Preparing between scenes.

There's nothing technically difficult in these jumps, it just sometimes hurts.

The same steel wire is used when shooting fights. To keep the pose, you have to use your abs and waist, the belts cut into legs. I don't know why don't they use the belt system, which cliffhangers use.

In the scene I'm being fiered with arrows, so I take cover under the armchair.

The gun weighted like a real one, the machinegun, on the contrary, was made of plastic and was very light. I had to manage it right when shaking. The bazooka was made of plastic foam, so I had to act as if it was heavy.
