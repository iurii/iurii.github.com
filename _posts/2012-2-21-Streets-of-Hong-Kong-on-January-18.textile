Hong Kong is way too narrow and overcrowded. Hong Kong girls are prettier than Chinese, and guys are more stylish,
though I think they're not as handsome as Chinese guys (which are not handsome). In Hong Kong people use
perfumes, not as much as Russians do, but surely more noticeable, than in perfumeless China.

Traditional tangerine trees for Chinese New Year. They say you'd better not eat them, because of pesticides inside.
