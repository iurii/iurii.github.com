Dongmen is like a zoo. Lots of people, everybody is watching everybody, be it a girl, or anyone catchy. You can't hide, you can't run, even if you get into closest MacDonalds, you'll find out there someone beside you, eathing popcorn and watching you and all your stuff. If you can't adjust your attitude right, this thing really annoys. As always, sense of humor is the savior.
