Every student has got a computer now, capable of processing millions of operations in a second. Did the students become more clever because of that? Everybody's got a cell phone. Have people become more free? It's even hard to imagine, that I'm without a phone, and that nobody can reach me. Yet they will find you. You'll get back to your home, take a glance at the screen of your phone, see that someone called you and then you'll have to call back, or else it would be not polite. Nowadays you can fly everywhere in several hours. Do people actually have more time now? You can search for any word in online dictionary. Do people really know more, than in times they were using paper dictionaries? Now people talk on the phone. Didn't it lead to less real-life meetings ? You are okay with not seeing someone for months, because you can talk via Skype or other messenger. Again, every employee has a computer of such capabilities, which were a dream for scientists 20 years ago. Why are the workers still working 8 hours per day? Can't they complete more tasks now? So what's the point? Wasn't that all about saving time ?

Technology is a kind of game, endless race, in which the looser is a person, because now he has to filter more information and trash. Technology steals our friends, family, our knowledge, and now it comes for our time. Everything is going in direction of technology, it's going "there". No matter what you do, you can't skip it. It's the second reality, the virtual world, where absolutely everybody is present.
What were people doing when there was no internet? Wathing TV (another technology). What was before TV? Radio, tape recorders, players and books. Well it's already another approach, a bit more esthetic one, don't you think ? So what was prior to Skype and ICQ? - Telephone. And before the telophone? Meetings in person. People were going to see someone, knoking the doors, and either there was noone at home, either someone opened the door.

Thus, there's no use of technology, only harm. Of course, I'm not talking aboud medicine. It seems to make sense for me. Though, as we all know 80% of all deceases comes from your own head, pressure at work and so on, so it's also a good question, if all that medicine is solving real problems or solving the problems which were caused by the technology itself.
