 Have I told you how much I like working in my company ? Today we had a meeting where our boss introduced to us new rules:
 You can't go out during work time. Even if it's 15 minutes to buy some breakfast.
 And there's also a new point system provided (which failed about two years ago). The idea is simple: every worker would get points.
 Points would be deducted for coming late (at the same time there's a fine 1RMB/1min being late), for bad work attitude, for bad performance, for anything which is not good for the company.
 In the end of the month you need to get at least 70 points. If you don't get them - your monthly salary will be deducted by 30%.
 And the organ which gives points - is the boss. So there's no workaround. How do you like that for a Tuesday news ? No wonder, so much people left the company.
 I'm sure there will be more people resigning, because of the new rules.
