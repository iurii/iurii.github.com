I wanted to take 3 days off to go to Chengdu, to record a show. My boss and some other people said "you already asked for day offs too much times", somebody said I have lots of work to do, someone says Russian co-workers can't reach me(yeah, sure, I'm every goddamn day in Skype and QQ).
The next day our administrator gave me my application where there was a note from my boss "I can't let go Yuriy because we've got lots of work to do" and a sign of the boss of the company. So, my boss didn't even let me know that he won't approve my application, yet gave it to sign to the superior boss and make me waste another 30 minutes to ask for another blank, fill it out and this time state that I ask for leave in terms of my annual vacation. He had no authority to disapprove my vacations, so he finally signed the application.
By the way, one of our co-workers is going to resign in a week. I'm even jeallous.
