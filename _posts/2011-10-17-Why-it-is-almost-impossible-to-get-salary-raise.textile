Asking for pay raise - is humiliating. Well, sometimes this moment comes and you have to deal with it.
So, you ask your direct boss for pay raise.
The first question he will ask will be "Why ?", in sense of on basis of what you are asking to get paid more, than before.
Normally, you will ask yourself these questions, before actually asking for pay raise, so that to get prepared for attack.
Immediately you'll get two sharp ideas which could serve as basis for raising your salary:

<b>1. Your qualification got higher. Say, you learned a new language or passed some specialized course on something.</b>
<b>2. You started working better, than before (half of year, year ago)</b>
These are basically two major ideas one could come up with.

So, you learned something new, the stuff you can apply during your work, or you started working faster.
The boss usually wants to get something back for raising your salary up. It's logical to think of "I'll work better" idea.
Give me 15% raise and I'll work 15% better. That's were the catch up hides: So, what were you doing before ? Aren't you supposed to work at you maximum 100% capability and paid for that ?
So that means you worked at 85%, while getting paid as for 100% ? You were cheating your company during the whole year. Not good.
Thus, the formula "more salary for getting more work done" is dangerous in sense of you confessing you weren't working at your maximum extent, as you were supposed to.
It looks like you're a bad employee.

Okay, let's suppose you learned something new. A new technology, or let it be learning super-fast blind typing method.
When did you learn that ? During your work time ? So you weren't working, instead were doing your own stuff ? And you dare to ask for raise ?
It wouldn't be that easy to proove you were learning stuff during your free time. Secondly, it should be a very good job, if you're willing to spend your free time on it.
So why would you ask for raise in the first place ? Isn't working already so fun ?

<b>Why you actually have right to ask raise over time:</b>

You have been in a company for a long time, prices got higher. Inflation, world oil prices, market goes up, etc.
Let's suppose inflation rate reached 10% last year. It means, after working in a company for a whole year,
you actually get 10% less salary, then you should. Thus, if you ask for 10% raise, taking prices which went up as an argument, it won't actually be a raise.
It would be just a compensation, allowing you to stay on the same level of buying potential, as you were a year ago. Which, however, goes in contrary with the concept of normal career growth,
where salary should grow at least every half of year, or once a year.

Thus, if you want to have ability to buy more, than a year before, you need to ask not only for 10% raise, which were eaten by inflation, but also another 10%, which would count as real raise.
In this way get necessity to get 20% raise, to feel it as a real raise, which, of course, is quite difficult to get.

The main argument to deny your asking for raise whould be the fact that companies don't give a shit about inflation.
You will be told, that company, as you, suffer losses because of inflation, making you look like a greedy employee, who doen't care for the company.
Let me say, it's a complete and total bullshit over here. Never buy this "we too suffer losses, market goes down - your salary goes down too".
First, if prises are raising for everything - oil, food, services, then it would make sense for your company to raise the prices too.
If company doesn't do that, the profit would go down, and the company might eventually become a bankrupt. If a company raises its prices for its service and goods,
it is also capable of raising your salary, or else it's cheating.

Even if the company hasn't raised its prices during the time when everybody did so, you still shouldn't bother too much.
The company tries to pull another piece of shit through your brains, and it's called "everybody suffer losses" - it's like a redneck
walking forward to you, appealing to the statement that "all people are brothers", and based on that statement you owe him some cash.
Because we are all dudes and brothers. Bullshit.
It's just another way to make you feel sorry for all poor people of the world, hungry children of Africa, or a war in Afghanistan.
Those excuses the company usually makes up in order to save some money might make sense, if you were asking for a raise for all your co-workers, not only you. But, hey, you're asking for a favor for only 1 person.
In terms of company, 100-200 USD is NOTHING.
So, believing that the company would get bankrupt just because they raised you salary - is the same as believing that if you want to get a good mark at University, there's only a hard way through study and earning good marks.
No matter from which angle you look at it - cheating is everywhere. So, when company rejects your request - it simply cheats you.
Even if you don't get the raise at first attempt - be brave and know your rights.
