p(meta). 5 July 2011 - Shenzhen

From general to detailed, what I gained during the trip to 长沙:

1. I fell in love with China again.
2. I fell in love with Chinese food again.
3. I fell in love with a Chinese girl.
4. Was living in a 5 star hotel.
5. Was attending bars and clubs with American, British, Japanese, Korean, Sirian show participants(just like in one of those jokes)
6. My performance at the show wasn't at the best level, yet I didn't fuck it up - I didn't drop my nunchaku, and didn't kill anybody. The flips went well too.
7. For the first time during last year I took a real bath - not standing, but lying.
8. During all five days my brains were turned off. I forgot everything.
9. Nunchaku can be taken to the airplane if they are in luggage.


<b>29-th of June. Wednesday. Day one.</b>
I woke up a 4 AM, packed my stuff, had some food, 6:45 I'm at the airport, the plane takes off at 7:25, which is 10 minutes earlier the schedule.
It's the 4th time in my life I'm flying. The first time using Chinese domestic airlines.
At 8:40 I arrive to Changsha. When the plane landed, a couple of cops suddenly rush to one of the passangers, saying: "Where's your luggage? Open up." Their tone of voice was like he's a criminal.
"Who was sitting with you ? Has anybody changed their places ? Dear passangers, please, check your hand luggage if anything was stolen". Nothing seemed to be stolen, but they frightened that guy.
A guy from TV studio met me, and took me to the hotel. A very nice hotel with prices about 900-1000 RMB per day, yet two-bedroom. I was going to live with a British guy, name was Byron.

Через пару часов прилетела основная часть людей - все из Пекина.
In a couple of hours the main part of the attendants of the show arrived - everyone's from Beijing.

The girls weren't that pretty. Half of them were so so.

At 14 o'clock we met for a lunch and discussed the upcoming show. We were told not to talk to each other too much, so that the next day everything seemed natural.

In the evening we went to the main street of the city - 步行街. It's very nice there - some ancient architecture, Mao Tze Dun, extremely delecious food at low prices.

After the dinner part of the crew and I returned to the hotel. I trained my splits. The other part went to the clubs. Byron was nervous about the dance he was going to perform during the show, so he got drunk and started smoking again. It didn't help though.

Yes, you feel lonely, when you're alone in the hotel, lights are turned off, and only lights of crane accross the road were shining in dark night. Or when before landing, and after you realize that you have no one you could send an SMS "The plane landed", "bye bye" etc. That's true solitude.

<b>30-th of June. Thursday. Day 2. Shooting the show</b>

We had a breakfast and were at the studio at 9:40. Had some rehearsal and were waiting when it's 14:00, because that's the actual time when we'll start to record the show. There was a piano, and I played rock'n'roll and Linkin Park - Numb. One woman, a manager, noticed me and said that it's good that I play piano, but still I need to concentrate on one thing and master it.
Then there was another rehearsal. I picked up the soundtrack for my performance - Skepta Rescue Me, which was cut to 1 minute or even less. I tried my nunchaku, did some flips. I wanted to do a wallflip, but there was no single wall I could jump off. The decoration were all on glue and could barely stand a push with a finger, not speaking about leg. 

<a href="http://s637.photobucket.com/albums/uu96/palamar4uk/?action=view&amp;current=changsha4.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i637.photobucket.com/albums/uu96/palamar4uk/changsha4.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>

<a href="http://s637.photobucket.com/albums/uu96/palamar4uk/?action=view&amp;current=changsha5.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i637.photobucket.com/albums/uu96/palamar4uk/changsha5.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>

Then we had lunch. Awesome one, and then waiting. Everybody change their clothes, made new haircuts, took some pictures, the CEO of the show arrived, we discussed the show one more time: Every guy would get 7 flowers of one color. The girls would get 7 strip-stickers of their own color. When everybody go on stage, there will be something like love from first sight - only after a few minutes of eye-contact, the guys should present the flowers to the girls they liked. The girls, in their turn, should stick the strips to the guys they liked. 

Then we had a discussion on why one girl had that much flowers, or why the other got such a variety of flowers (meaning everybody liked her). In our case, most of the girls vere the same or above our age, many of them didn't actually care.Потом должно было быть обсуждение того, почему у той или другой девчонки больше всего цветов, или почему такой большое разнообразие цветов (значит типа всем понравилась). На самом же деле, девчонки в основном были или нашего возраста, или даже старше нас, многим вообще было пофиг на нас. Кроме того, среди нас был даже один гей. 

Prior the shooting, I put nunchaku near the speakers. I have a habit of checking everything - just before the show I go up on the stage to find out that nunchaku are not there, they were taken away somewhere, considere as extra prep. And I wanted them to be kept just near the speakers, so that I can get them on the spot, and so that the audience would never see them.

The show started, we were sitting and sweating under the lights. My performance was nubmer 5, and it wasn't very good, because the more I kept seeting in the same pose under the lights, the more unflexible my muscles were becoming. Now, when the British guy finished his dance, there were some questions to Mido(Sirian guy), who said they can have up to 4 wifes in Siria. Not everybody got a performance, yet my turn came up.

The host gave my nunchaku, though I planned using it later. I said "it's better to put them there" and put them on the prior place. I barely had any time. The music will start in a moment. I don't have any single second for warm up. I run up to my chair, put the mic and the table (every guy had a table, discribing his style, like a "British gentleman", "Korean nerd" etc, I was "Kungfu man). I hear the music, do a coulpe of flips, realize, that my glasses are still on me, so I through them away in a sliding manner, so that the lens don't get scratches.
There's no place! Guys on the left, hotties on the right. I'm doing my best, and even sacrifice some flashy movements, in order to guarantee that nobody gets hurt, or that nunchaku don't slip off my hand. There won't be second chance. Besides, it's the 3rd most watchable tv show in China.

My performance lasted for only 1 minute, yet it was really tough. First I got tired with acrobatics and flips, and then, being tired needed to switch to nunchaku, where you need relaxed muscles. I couldn't use nunchaku from the beginning because I didn't know how much time I got. I can play with nunchaku forever, but acrobatics needs lots of strenght. Sure thing, for the sake of success I tried to do only the simplest tricks. Again, nobody got hurt, nunchaku didn't slip off - that's very good already.
I was deadly tired after that 1 minute.

Besides all that, I was wearing the shoes I bought the day before, and they were a bit too big for me. The pants were from the suit. Glad that they didn't tear apart, haha!

We continued the show, which was tiresome, not only because of the lights, but also mentally. At the end the girls should pick the guys. So there were only two pairs who liked each other. The girl I liked didn't pick me. As she said later - she was afraid of my nunchaku.

After show we took some pictures and actually we were very happy that everything ended and we could take a breath.
We went back to the hotel, freshed up and went back to the center. We went to the place with local food - delicious and not expensive. 9 people spent only 250-300 RMB for everything.

The other people from the crew joined us later. We went to the bar to have some drinks. I was drinking Margarita and got drunk soon. In the same bar I met a waitress with whom I felt in love later on.
We had very nice chat with her. It was just what I needed that time.
Then we went to the other bar, found some girls, I got a telephone number of one of them. I must say, the phrase "I'm in Changsha for shooting 天天向上 tv show“ sound pretty funny.

Next there was an awesome moment. We ended up in the clup with some strange shows. First there were drink contests, and then the striptease.
There was a moment, when hosts started looking for a guy to be tortured by the sexiest girl. Suddenly, one of our organizers - drunk 30 y.o. american goes up on stage. He's tied up by ropes, and then the girl tortures him, and he pretends it's painful. She takes off his shirt, unzips his pants, and... puts a piece of ice in his pants.
Then the American says something to the hosts, and the next thing I remember is they push me on the stage. The first thought "okay, striptease it be, take off my clothes". Sure thing, they wouldn't make the some thing twice, so I needed to perform some kungfu. And I had no nunchaku.

I must say, I never did anything like acrobatics when I'm drunk. When you are drunk, your vestibular apparatus doesn't work properly. It's easy to fall. Still, I did a couple of flips, some good-looking kicks in the air, and nothing could stop me except the host.

Suddenly there's a Chinese guy jumping out of nowhere, saying he knows "Chinese kungfu". He stands in front of me, takes off his shirt and makes that expression, which supposed to show everybody how extremely cool he is(aha, sure). My thought "are we going to fight now?". No. He perfomed some stuff, almost fell of the stage, made a wheel and that's all. He tried so much, but couldn't beat me. We were winners again, hahah. It was an awesome evening.

<b>1st of July. Friday. Day 3.</b>

The last day in the awesome hotel. Byron, Mido and I left it and went to center, where Byron booked another awesome 5 star hotel. He booked online, so it was twice cheaper than if we took it on the spot. 398 RMB versus 800 RMB. The rooms were awesome. Even safes were there, not talking about hundreds of towels, glasses, awesome bath and all the stuff.

During launch we went to the center of the city to grab some food. Alec - the guy from the show -joined us. Alec is a mix of British and Japanese blood. Wants to be an actor. Adequate guy.
Then we went back to hotel, freshed up and had some sleep.
In the evening we went to the same street with bars. We were drinking whiskey with apple juice. One hottie joined us and we went to karaoke to join the director and her friends. We were drinking and singing. I was singing Elvis Presley - Hound Dog. Good thing is my voice is very suitable to sing this kind of songs. I was trying to make out with one of the girls, but she was too traditional, so I ended up with nothing. It was 3 AM, I went to another club, danced with a girl, and then left the place, as she wasn't too willing to talk to me. She was hanging out with a bunch of black guys. I returned home and went to bed.

The view from my room - karaoke where we were hanging out. The second time in karaoke. This time I liked it.

<b>2nd of July. Saturday. Day four.</b>

Mido and Byron went homw. I stayed alone and finally could enjoy my solitude. I had fun riding buses, went to 世界之窗 (Window of the world). I went on hills, took some pictures. Found a lighthouse, and got that feeling of "Alexander" movie. Once again I feel I'm where I belong.
I send SMSes to the waitress.

This is the lighthouse which attracted me that much. I couldn't get to the top though, as all the doors were closed.

In the evening I went to the same street. Went to the club, danced a bit, then went to the bar where I met the waitress. Then I realized that I like bars more then clubs.

<a href="http://s637.photobucket.com/albums/uu96/palamar4uk/?action=view&amp;current=changsha9.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i637.photobucket.com/albums/uu96/palamar4uk/changsha9.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>

The music is not too loud. You can have a sit, no need to say anything. I was treating the waitress, she was treating me. Sometimes we were drinking some low-alcohol drinks or just juice. We were talking, I was holding her hand. Her eyes were so attracting, so that I felt I'd better die, then stop watching them even for a second. She was at work, though, so there were periods of time when I was sitting alone. Sometimes chatting with some guys, girls, enjoying live music, faded light and absense of boring people. Then she would appear again, right out of nowhere, we would chat, chat, and drink. It was that rare case when you like almost anything. Her every expression, the speed it takes for her to turn her head, the way she waves her eyelashes or lifts up her brows. I really felt in love.
Then we were playing pool with her, it was 3 AM. I said I'm waiting her to take her with me. In the end I sent her to the taxi, and when chatting by SMS during night, I found out she has a boyfriend she's going to merry. I was very sad, yet the next day it all became that bitter-sweet flavored memory. I don't regret anything. It's always good when there's a story, and it doesn't need to alwasy be a happy-end.

<b>3rd of July. Sunday. Day five.</b>

The next day I wandered a bit around the city, ate some delicious stuff, took some pictures of authentic China. Realized, I like south with all its heat, wind, summer clothes and sun.

At 14:00 I checked out from the hotel. At 14 30 the car from the studio arrived to my hotel. The driver took me to the airport, and was still thinking about that cute, pretty beautiful waitress, name is 王微.

There was a dinner at the airplane. Shenzhen was a bit different, yet almost the same.

I understood that travelling will save me. As well as progress and reaching my dream.
P.S. Changsa girls have bigger tits than other Chinese girls.
