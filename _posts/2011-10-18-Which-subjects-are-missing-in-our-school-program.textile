Why music class disappears after the 7th grade ?
Why during music classes we only sing to the accompaniment of teacher's piano ?
Why does drawing lesson disappears after the 7th grade ?
Why we never had dancing lessons ?
Why did physical training become optional ?
Why we never had lessons of dramatic art ?
Where did the modelling go ? Did I miss it out ?
Why does labor lessons disappear after 9th grade ?

All those important things are lost and are not coming back after we graduate from middle school. But on the other hand in high school we get economics, history, geography. Chemistry, physics and mathematics, of course, are counted as the most important lessons. For who ? For future scientists ? What about normal people ? Spend your time on the stuff you barely have any interest in, so that you can get good marks and make it to the university, to some shity faculty, to work as a manager later, and still having that beautiful and useless certificate of a "tech-guy" in your hands. What's the point ?

I'd say that drawing + modelling and other lessons of this kind should be concidered as most important, as they develop creativity, which will help a person in all possible fields of life. Ideal case is to choose yourself what you like. Every person has a talent, being better at something, and being not too good at other things. It's obvious, that getting to your maximum potential is possible only by doing what you really like.

<b>The answer is simple</b>: the government has its plan. How many welders, economists, engineers, scientists and mathematicians to produce. That's why the school program is actually all about fulfilling the government plan. Our state doesn't need poets, musicians, artists.

I was working as a teacher of English in Gymboree - a school for 0-5 y.o. kids. And I could see the innovative approach implemented by the teachers. These kind of schools are way better than ordinary preschool institutes. But hey, when will those kids go when they turn 6-7 years old ? Right, to a normal school. Why? Because in the end everybody needs to make it to the colledge, so you need to prepare for it, meaning study lots of stuff you might not be interested in.
