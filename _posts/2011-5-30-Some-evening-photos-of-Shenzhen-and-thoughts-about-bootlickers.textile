Night is the most enjoyable time. Nobody stares you, nobody shouts "Hallo", you can go where you want to, you can stop where you want to, think and feel.

I hate my boss. I hate his gay-like hand wave to make me come to his desk and talk about some unimportant shit.
Today in the morning I was buying some food for the breakfast, at the same time reading my Chinese vocabulary. Suddenly I see a hand coming out from my back, pushing my vocabulary. I turn my head around and see him. I don't know what did he want to do, but I really really hate when people I don't like touch me or my things.
And the programmer on the right - he glares at my screen whenever there's a chance. Tolerate ? Hell with it. I can't help hating brown-nosy boot-lickers. Coincidentally the guy on the right and the boss are from the same place and have the same habbits.
I believe one should surround himself with outstanding, passionate people who share the same ideas and dreams. This way the possibility to succeed is much higher. Sure thing, I'm idealizing, but that's the stuff in my head.
