I've been listening to Tim Ferris's "Four hour work week" and decided to write down some of his good ideas.

8 Rules that change the rules:

1. Everything that popular is wrong.
2. Focus on been productive and not busy.
3. Beating the game, not playing the game.
4. Different is better when it is more effective or more fun.
5. Ask for forgiveness, not permission.
6. Emphasise strength, don't fix weaknesses. Focuse on better use of your best
weapons instead of constant repair.
7. Things in excess become their opposite. More becomes less, etc.
8. Money alone is not a solution.
