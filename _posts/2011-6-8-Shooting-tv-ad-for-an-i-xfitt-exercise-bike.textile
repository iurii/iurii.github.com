p(meta). 8 June 2011 - Shenzhen

Couple of days ago I passed a casting for the tv ad by simply showing my biceps. Though it was the easiest casting in my life, I still had no idea of what exactly we're going to shoot and why they wanted someone with a good body.
On the day of shooting, just in case, I took some gym clothes, some shirts, pants. When I came to the spot, I finally understood what we're going to shoot(it's so Chinese - not to tell anything till it starts). I grew up on Chuck Norris's ads of "Total Gym", and was watching lots of other similar stuff when I was a kid, so I was pretty much excited about the opportunity to change the roles and become the guy on tv who's going to explain how to deal with the body-building machine.
I arrived at 8 (had to woke up at 5 AM), and the shooting started at 9 o'clock. We were shooting all day long, having a little break for a lunch and a dinner. Tottally 12 hours of shooting, from 9 AM to 9 PM.

We had two parts:
1. The most difficult one. Me and my partner (Blizzy from USA, a 20 y.o. girl) were riding these excercise bikes, showing different ways of riding, some stretching techniques, explaining how to adjust the apparatus.
The most tiresome part, as we had lots of scenes, each scene had several shots, and it was hot because it's summer in Shenzhen, as well as the lightning was heating the shooting spot. You could feel the difference by simply making two steps in the direction from the lights, and then a couple of steps back on the stage.
We finished this part somewhere around 15-16 o'clock.
2. The second part was a sort of tv commercial, me and Bizzy are married, and we have a kid (8 y.o. Russian model, called Sofia - very charming and cute little girl).
We are arguing with the wife about what to present to her parents. I want iPhone, she speaks about clothes. Then our daughter runs by, gives us a hug, runs away to the exercise bicycle and suddenly my wify's got an idea - we should buy them the same exercise bicycle.
We had two sets of clothes for this part - 1) clothes we wear at home 2) clothes we wear in office. - this last part I was playing a role of busy husband, working with papers, notebook, answering telephone calls, then I suddenly find this bike online and it's way better then others. So we go with the bike.
There were also several scenes with Bizzy and Sofia, without me, then we waited for a car for like 40 mins. I arrived home at 23:15. Tired, yet happy. I like acting, I like analyzing the person, and trying to express the emotions in the best possible way. It's so fun, uncomparable with emotionless office work.
