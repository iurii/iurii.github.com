If you do all that you seem to be doing well. That's the model, model of a successful man.
I have doubts about that though. I mean I think there should be something more, not just job, but aspiration, dreams, goals, etc. These things have nothing to with being a good obedient employee, as well as it has nothing to do with wife or girls.

Everybody should have their purpose. And if you feel awesome living that life - I can congratulate you. As for me, I need to change my job, but that's all I need at the moment. No wify, no children, no stuff which would hold me to one place.

I registered for a show today - called 智永大冲关 - I'd translate it as "Wise and brave, go for it!".
I find those shows, and send CVs, and that's probably everything I can do now. Do it good and hope for a miracle. I think nobody would give me a job as a tv host immediately, but I really need to get to work on the tv studio. Maybe editing video would be a good start. I don't care about money, as long as there's a place to live, and something to eat, but I do care about learning new stuff. If I stay in my current company for another several months, I'll die of boredom and stupidity. Need to make changes, would be good to find a job on TV(it's my dream!) withing 1-2 months. Let's work hard and hope. I feel success coming. Knocking in my doors.
