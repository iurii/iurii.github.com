p(meta). 7 March 2012 - Shenzhen

I asked for 5 days off next week. Company didn't approve that. I said I quit, the secretary tried to make me think it over and stay in the company. They asked to change the reason for leaving for "personal reasons".

Friday - last day. Freedom. Have no idea what to do next.
